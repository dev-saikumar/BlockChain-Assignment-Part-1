Compile as: "g++ main.cpp -o main"

Run as: "./main n z0 z1 t_blk t_txn eventCount"

Parameters (all integer): 
    n: number of nodes
    z0: Percent of fast link miners
    z1: Percent of fast cpu miners
    t_blk: block interarrival time
    t_txn: interarrival between transactions generated by a miner
    eventCount: simulate for <eventCount> events

Ex: ./main 10 10 50 120 60 1000000
    10 nodes/miners/peers
    10% nodes are fast link
    50% nodes are fast CPU
    block interarrival time = 120 seconds
    60 seconds transaction interarrival time
    simulate for 1 million events

NOTE: graphviz must be installed and dot must be added to path for tree generation, if not 
installed press "n" during the tree generation prompt.

After the simulation is completed two prompts are shown 
    1. "Generate per-miner simulation data (y/n): ", press "y" to generate simulation data like 
        block arrival time, fork length, etc. 
    2. "Generate per-miner tree (Note: graphviz must be installed, press n if not installed) (y/n): ", press 'y' to generate graph.

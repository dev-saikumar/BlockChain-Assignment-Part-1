Compile as: "g++ main.cpp -o main"

Run as: "./main n z0 z1 t_blk t_txn eventCount"

Parameters:
    n: number of nodes
    z0: Percent of fast link miners
    z1: Percent of fast cpu miners
    t_blk: block interarrival time
    t_txn: interarrival between transactions generated by a miner
    eventCount: simulate for <eventCount> events

After the simulation is completed two prompts are shown 
    1. "Generate per-miner data (y/n): ", press "y" to generate graph and simulation data for individual miner. 
    2. "Generate per-miner tree (Note: graphviz must be installed, press n if not installed) (y/n): ", press 'y' to generate graph.

NOTE: graphviz must be installed and dot must be added to path for graph generation, if not installed press "y".
